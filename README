Python package to do discrete Markov random field learning and inference.

For now, this software is very experimental and for private use only.

# To-Do before public release

1. Finish adding docstring to at least all public methods
2. Add tests to get full code coverage
3. Update readme to have documentation
4. Re-organize directory and package to make a properly installable package with documentation API readable on readthedocs
